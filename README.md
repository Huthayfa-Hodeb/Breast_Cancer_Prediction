# Breast_Cancer_Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I used the XGBoost algorithm to build the model and achieved an accuracy of 97.07% on the test set.
